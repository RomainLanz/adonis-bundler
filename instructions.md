## Registering provider

The provider is registered inside `start/app.js` file under `providers` array.

```js
const providers = [
  'adonis-bundler/providers/BundlerProvider'
]
```

That's all you need!
No need to worries about configuration, just use what you like for your assets and run `adonis bundle`.
